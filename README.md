## 🧩 Problem Statement

> *Voice Agent for Real-Time Auction Participation and Bidding*  
> Online auctions move fast — bids change in seconds, and users can miss out if they can’t act quickly.  
>  
> The goal is to build a voice agent using *OmniDimension* that connects to a live or simulated auction system, provides real-time product and bidding information, and allows users to place bids via voice. The system should report highest bids, total bids per product, and (optionally) bidding history — enabling a seamless voice-first experience for online auctions.
